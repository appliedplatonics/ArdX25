\chapter{Introduction}
This document is a recap of my experiences implementing packet radio
on the AVR/Arduino platform.  Its goal is to document the process, as
well as offering some exposition (and hopefully insight) on the
various techniques used in the process of the build.


\section{What is Packet Radio?}

Packet Radio is a set of technologies for sending data over amateur
radio connections.  The particular technologies used here are
equivalent to a 1200 baud modem, which is still relatively fast in the
ham radio world.
