\section{Description}

AFSK1200 is a subset of the old Bell202 modem standard\cite{ruafsk1200}.

\section{Modulation}

To modulate the signal, we use the Atmega328's timer functionality.
This allows us to set up an interrupt which is called every so many
clocks.  In this interrupt, we tweak a PWM constant, which is then
used to output a digital approximation of a sine wave.
